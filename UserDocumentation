Objective:
Guess what a 5 lettered word is within 6 attempts.

Rule:
The words that are used as guesses must be in the Engish dictionary.

Gameplay:
Users will be prompted asking if they want to exit the game or play again when attempts have been exhausted or when the word has been guessed. 
The attempt number is incremented after the guess is accepted. Game completion occurs when N is entered. Entering Y restarts the game. 
The attempt number is displayed above the prompt that asks the user to enter their word. The guess will appear below the prompt after it's entered besides it
with its letters being coloured green, yellow or red. Red letters are not in the answer, whereas green and yellow letters are. Green means that the guesses 
letters' positions, or position, within the guess and answer are identical.
