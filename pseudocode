create empty dictionary target_words
open file target_words.txt
    for each word in the file:
        strip the word of leading and trailing whitespaces
        if the word is not in target_words, add it as a key with value 1
        if the word is already in target_words, increment its value by 1
close file target_words.txt
create a list of keys from target_words called target_words_keys
choose a random word from target_words_keys and assign it to target_word
return target_word

Assign the result of calling the function 'get_random_word' to the variable 'answer'
